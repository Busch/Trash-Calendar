Trash-Calendar
==============


This is a iCal generator - generating a trash-calendar in a german district called Ostalbkreis for every device that supports calDAV.

The code itself is too specific, so it isn`t much useful for others to adopt.

A running live demo can be seen [here](https://dav.datenschleuder.com/).

Currently supported devices are:

* Apple iPhone
* Apple iPod
* Apple iPad
* Apple Computer with OSX
* Limited support for Outlook (through thrird party plugins) and Thunderbird (Lightning plugin)
* Probaby every other Calendar, that support calDAV
